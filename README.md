To use `gen`, you will need a valid Gemini API key set in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.
> [!NOTE]
If you don't already have one, go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup) to create a key.

## Single-turn Examples
Plain text generation  
`$ gen dix noms de fleurs`

At the command line, you may have to put the prompt inside double quotes to avoid confusing the shell  
`$ gen "a scheme function to compute the Levenshtein distance between two strings; only the code"`

Pipe content into gen and save its output in a text file  
`$ cat cmd.go | gen -f - what does this code do? | tee report.txt`

Obtain the token count  
`$ gen -t how many tokens would this prompt consume?`

Parameterize prompts  
`gen -p a=1 -p b=2 "complete this sentence: replace {a} apple with {a} banana and {b} oranges for a good ..."`

Set a system instruction from stdin and prompt from argument  
`echo "you understand english but always reply in french" | gen -s -f - ten names for flowers`

Set a system instruction from file option and prompt from argument  
`gen -f french.sprompt ten names for flowers"`

Set a system instruction from argument and enter chat  
`gen -c -s you understand english but always answer in German`

Attach two files to the prompt and return total token count  
`gen -t -f ../twitter/img/123497680.jpg -f ../twitter/img/123406895.jpg what are the differences between these photos?`

Enter chat mode to generate various SQL statements  
`cat classicmodels.sql | gen -f - -c`

Generate an architecture decision record using a parameterized template  
`gen -f adr.sprompt -p certified="certified AWS Solution Architect Professional" an architecture decision record to help my organization decide between storage technologies for storing and accessing 10TB worth of time series data - please provide concrete examples and figures where possible`

List known Gemini models by invoking tool  
`gen -tool list known generative models`

Extract entities from text  
`w3m -dump https://lite.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html | gen -json -f - extract entities`

System instruction and prompts as files from iterative Prisonner's Dilemma [paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.13605v1)  
`gen -json -f pd.sprompt -f pd.prompt`

Chain of thought  
`gen Please answer this question starting in two ways. First start with yes, then start with no and show your work. Afterwards determine which is correct. Is 3307 a prime number?`

Generate sequence diagram from code using PlantUML system instruction  
`gen -f puml.sprompt -f ~/lib/Duke/duke-core/src/main/java/no/priv/garshol/duke/Duke.java sequence diagram of the main_ method in this file`

## Multi-turn Example
Generate a brief using an adapted version of Ali Abassi's prompt  
`gen -c -f brief.sprompt -f brief.prompt -p role="Sr. Business Analyst" -p department="ACME Technology Solutions" -p task="create a project brief" -p deliverable="project brief"`

## Usage
```
Usage: gen [options] <prompt>

Command-line interface to Google Gemini large language models
  Requires a valid GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable set.
  Content is generated by a prompt and optional system instructions.
  Use - to assign stdin as prompt argument or as attached file.

Options:
  -V    output model details, system instructions and chat history
        details include model name | maxInputTokens | maxOutputTokens | temp | top_p | top_k
  -c    enter chat mode after content generation
        type two consecutive blank lines to exit
        not supported on windows when stdin used
  -f value
        file to attach where value is the path to the file
        use extensions .prompt and .sprompt for user and system instructions respectively
        repeat for each file
  -h    show this help message and exit
  -json
        response in JavaScript Object Notation
  -m string
        generative model name (default "gemini-1.5-flash")
  -p value
        prompt parameter value in format key=val
        replaces all occurrences of {key} in prompt with val
        repeat for each parameter
  -s    treat argument as system instruction
        unless stdin is set as file
  -t    output total number of tokens
  -temp float
        changes sampling during response generation [0.0,2.0] (default 1)
  -tool
        invoke one of the tools {KnownModels,RetrieveAWSAccountIDs}
  -top_p float
        changes how the model selects tokens for generation [0.0,1.0] (default 0.95)
  -unsafe
        force generation when gen aborts with FinishReasonSafety
  -v    show version and exit
```
