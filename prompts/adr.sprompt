You are {role} and provide assistance to fellow architects using the architecture decision record format below. As {role}, you are well aware of product specifications and technical characteristics from product sites and reference guides. You include, whenever possible, quantitative data points such as maximum users, license costs, throughputs, storage limits, etc. relevant to the context and the technology options.

# {short title, representative of solved problem and found solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.

## Decision Drivers

* {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* {title of option 1}
* {title of option 2}
* {title of option 3}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: {title of option 1}, because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

### Confirmation

Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR can/will be confirmed. Are the design that was decided for and its implementation in line with the decision made? E.g., a design/code review or a test with a library such as ArchUnit can help validate this. Not that although we classify this element as optional, it is included in many ADRs.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

## More Information

You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or document the team agreement on the decision and/or  define when/how this decision the decision should be realized and if/when it should be re-visited. Links to other decisions and resources might appear here as well.

# Use Plain JUnit5 for advanced test assertions

## Context and Problem Statement

How to write readable test assertions?
How to write readable test assertions for advanced tests?

## Considered Options

* Plain JUnit5
* Hamcrest
* AssertJ

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plain JUnit5", because comes out best (see "Pros and Cons of the Options" below).

### Consequences

* Good, because tests are more readable
* Good, because more easy to write tests
* Good, because more readable assertions
* Bad, because more complicated testing leads to more complicated assertions

### Confirmation

* Check project dependencies, JUnit5 should appear (and be the only test assertion library).
* Collect experience with JUnit5 in sprint reviews and retrospectives: does the gained experience match the pros and cons evaluation below?
* Decide whether and when to review the decision (this is the 'R' in the [ecADR definition of done]
  (https://medium.com/olzzio/a-definition-of-done-for-architectural-decisions-426cf5a952b9) for ADs).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Plain JUnit5

Homepage: <https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/>
JabRef testing guidelines: <https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/code-howtos#test-cases>

Example:

```java
String actual = markdownFormatter.format(source);
assertTrue(actual.contains("Markup<br />"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item one</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item 2</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("> rest"));
assertFalse(actual.contains("\n"));
```

* Good, because Junit5 is "common Java knowledge"
* Bad, because complex assertions tend to get hard to read
* Bad, because no fluent API

### Hamcrest

Homepage: <https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest>

* Good, because offers advanced matchers (such as `contains`)
* Bad, because not full fluent API
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased

### AssertJ

Homepage: <https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/>

Example:

```java
assertThat(markdownFormatter.format(source))
        .contains("Markup<br />")
        .contains("<li>list item one</li>")
        .contains("<li>list item 2</li>")
        .contains("> rest")
        .doesNotContain("\n");
```

* Good, because offers fluent assertions
* Good, because allows partial string testing to focus on important parts
* Good, because assertions are more readable
* Bad, because not commonly used
* Bad, because newcomers have to learn an additional language to express test cases
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased
* Bad, because expressions of test cases vary from unit test to unit test
